# Bioengineering Honor Society Website Course Map

Language: React.js, HTML, CSS

Motivation: Serve as a guide to the prerequisites and requirements of bio courses given that it's hard to analyze and retrieve information from the course catalog I created this website over summer. Still working on finishing all the upper div requirements an then will integrate into bioehs.berkeley.edu.
